This is a password management tool to generate and store robust passwords.
You simply type a service name and an account ID and it will generate a password for you.
Alternatively, if you have your own password you can also store it as it is.

## HOW TO USE
1. Clone or download the repo and navigate to that directory.
2. Setup environmetal variables below if necessary:
  - `PW_LENGTH (optional)`: Integer. Length of passwords generated by this software (Default is 50 letters long).
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `node app.js`. You are going to be asked to create the admin password.
5. (Optional) Run `node two_factor_auth.js` to setup 2FA. See below for more details.


## ENABLE TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (2FA)
It is a highly effective security measure. Once you enable 2FA, you will have to enter a one-time password along with your normal password when you login.
### HOW TO ENABLE 2FA
0. Make sure that you have run `node app.js` preiously, so that database and admin password is set up correctly
1. Run `node two_factor_auth.js`
2. Downlaod either `Microsoft Authenticator` or `Google Authenticator` on your smartphone
3. Scan the QR code in your terminal from the authenticator app
4. You are all set! From the next time you run `node app.js`, you are going to be prompted to enter 2FA.

### TODOs
- Root password encryption with sha-512
- Passwords encryption with RSA keys (node-rsa)
- Deploy to a online server (really necessary?)
- Require pw twice when they first create it
- Hide root pw when typed
